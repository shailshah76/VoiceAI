So, what we're looking at here is the Latent Dirichlet Algorithm, or LDA, which is the engine powering our topic extraction. The key is that LDA statistically associates every word in a document with a "latent" or hidden topic, allowing us to essentially reverse-engineer the document's core themes by maximizing the relationships between documents, topics, and individual words. With these topics now identified, let's see how we can now apply them in practice.
