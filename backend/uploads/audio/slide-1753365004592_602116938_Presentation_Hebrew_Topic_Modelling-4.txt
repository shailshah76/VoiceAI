So, what this slide introduces is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm, or LDA. Essentially, it's a generative model that associates every word in a document with a latent, or hidden, topic, which allows us to convert an unstructured document into a structured form of topics and words. By maximizing the product of these associations, we can identify the most relevant topics within a body of text, which then informs the analysis you'll see on the next slide.
